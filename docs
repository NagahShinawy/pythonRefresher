static methods: is not matter which  obj you use to call static method. it is shared.
               : method does the same for all objs

================
Only use @staticmethod when you want to place a method inside a class that is logically related to the class,
but does not necessarily interact with any specific instance.

- all objs share the same (method) logic.

===========================
add subclass to note that, output is different based on class that call the method (parent class or child class)


@classmethod
def get_info(cls):
    """dynamic implementation of method based on cls
    whatever class you call, it execute based ob class
    """
    print(f"You are using ({cls.__name__}) with count {cls.counts}")
